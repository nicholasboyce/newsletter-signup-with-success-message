## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I realized I had become kind of focused on having responsive = fluid, when that isn't always the case. Sometimes, responsive is just that - whatever works best for the screen size. With that in mind, I decided to commit to two different sizes and orientations for the card instead of having it be multiple different sizes based off of screen width.

### Useful resources

- [Aligning list image with text](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14709538/aligning-list-style-image-proportionally-with-text) - This helped me decide between using list-style-image and doing the method as seen here which allows for better text alignment with the image.
